# Sparx Maths Autocompleter

A work-in-progress NodeJS Sparx Maths completer using their own APIs!


## Installation

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Add credentials to `.env`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woody-willis/sparx-autocompleter
cd sparx-autocompleter

npm install
npm start
```

If you get an `Error: Failed to refresh token.`, please wait a few seconds and try again. I'm not entirely sure why this happens but it's probably a security thing within Sparx.
